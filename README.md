# Dryer_Unit_operations_1
This is a repository for the 1st lab in Unit Operations 1 about the  drying process. The objective in the  removal of volatile liquid (usually water) from solids. We are trying to find the equilibrium humidity in our samples and the drying constant that we can use to scale up our  process.
